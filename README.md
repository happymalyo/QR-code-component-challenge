## My process

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It's a bit  dificult for me to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .card to work and be seen as the style guide declared.

Some code snippets:


```css
body {
	background: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	display: flex;
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	height: 100vh;
}

.card {
	max-width: 17rem;
	padding: 1rem;
	background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	margin-bottom: 1rem;
	border-radius: 0.625rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve my css skills everyday
